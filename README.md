**Abstract**

Prior to 2003, killer whales were considered a rare occurrence in Hood Canal. Acoustic recordings from the US Navy submarine base at Bangor and reports from long time residents of Hood Canal, suggest both resident and transient type killer whales have been present in Hood Canal. However, the frequency of reports is extremely low. Additionally, when whales have been observed in Hood Canal it has been for no more than one or two days. In January of 2003, 11 transient-type, mammal-eating killer whales arrived in Hood Canal and remained exclusively within the canal for 59 days. The extended stay of such a large group of transients was considered atypical. Anecdotal observations suggest these whales were feeding on harbor seals and bio-energetic estimates suggested more than half of the seal population should have been removed. Subsequent aerial surveys in 2003 and 2004 have not shown a significant decline in seal abundance, and, in January of 2005, six different transient type killer whales arrived in Hood Canal and stayed for 172 days. Bio-energetic and observation estimates suggest a similar level of removal occurred during the 2005 event, but harbor seal surveys in 2005 also do not exhibit a sharp decline. This chapter will review details of these two extended foraging events, parameters and predictions of the bio-energetic model and an evaluation of harbor seal aerial surveys to determine the population impact of these killer whale predation events.
